### Context:
Week 2 of mod 1  

Deanna - We did at least 6 hours of sync work together. Individually estimating another 7 hours of work each individually. We tried to make the most of the situation in working together and communicating asap thru slack and utilizing time in study hall when we could both be available. Lex had a family emergency and I was glad that working async worked well for us and we were able to accomodate his availability. It certainly didn't take away from his dedication and attention to the project.  

Lex - I was working on it for a few hours extra every night, if not making progress on the actual project then just through tinkering with what I could do or research. I sent a large amount of articles to Deanna.

### Learning Goals:  
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript  
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively
- Utilizing our knowledge of unit testing to view the html alongside javascript and what we need with the css, all marries the knowledge through the dom to make a functional website.
- Practice reading and understanding code written by other team members

### Wins + Challenges:
- We had a massive hurdle to overcome in my unexpected travel. The plane trips made communication fairly difficult on the second day of the project but even in spite of that, it was such a massive win to be able to work together to solve all of our code issues.
- Meeting up early in the morning and having some late nights coding made for a very smooth project. Continuous communication was also very helpful
- Great partnering through continuous dedication to our DTR and norms and communication style as we adapted in live time to any unexpected schedule changes
- We shifted to doing a mix of sync and async work but maintained constant communication 
- We became better at troubleshooting by inspecting elements in Dev Tools, researching methods of targeting DOM elements and pseudocoding a plan for each step of the project. 
- Great partnering, positive attitude and complete dedication to the project made it very successful
