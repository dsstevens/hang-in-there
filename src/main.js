iteration 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~
TARGET THE INNERHTML TO CREATE NEW & SAVE
On the new poster form view, users should be able to fill out the three input fields and then hit the Show My Poster button
--> the query selector, event listener and function are made! :)
----> still need the show my poster button to work

When the Show My Poster button is clicked, several things will happen:
--> idk y it takes us back to main (for now)

Use the values from the inputs to create a new, unique poster object (part of your data model)
--> call upon the createPoster function to create the poster object

Save the submitted data into the respective arrays (image URL into the images array, etc - all part of your data model) so that future random posters can use the user-created data
--> create a function to push input into savedposters, caption, phrase, & image source array

Change back to the main poster view (hiding the form view again)
--> this should work w our hidden views, double check

Use the new, unique poster object (part of your data model) to display the newly created poster image, title, and quote in the main view on the DOM
--> write a function to display poster, using the currentCover variable given

*** hint***
Is something weird happening when you click the button? Try googling event.preventDefault()!

iteration 3
~~~~~~~~~~~
When a user clicks the “Save This Poster” button, the current main poster will be added to the savedPosters array.
--> savePoster function done
----> .push method

If a user clicks the “Save This Poster” more than once on a single poster, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates)
--> create a truthy/falsy variable for a conditional

When a user clicks the “Show Saved Posters” button, we should see the saved posters section
All the posters in the savedPosters array should be displayed in the saved posters grid section
--> create a function as an event handler?
----> target the section with innerHTML as an empty string
------> because working off an array, for loop?



iteration 4
~~~~~~~~~~~
From the saved posters view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted
HTML onclick attributes should not be used in any HTML code - all functionality should be through JavaScript
--> event listener for the image with the dblclick event
----> event bubbling to target the section where the image is in saved posters view
